# DHT11 Sensor Simulator (No Hardware Required)

This project simulates a **DHT11 temperature & humidity sensor** entirely in software.  
It generates realistic sensor readings with noise, drift, and occasional failures — just like a real embedded device.

This project is designed for:
- Students without hardware who want to practice embedded-style logic  
- Logging, monitoring, or testing applications  
- Demonstration in CV/portfolio when applying for embedded software roles

## 🚀 Features
- Simulated DHT11 temperature & humidity values  
- Random Gaussian noise for realistic reading  
- Slow drift over time to emulate environment change  
- Random read failure simulation  
- Logs all readings to a CSV file  
- Fully configurable via CLI arguments
